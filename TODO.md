# TODO

* [ ] post when new show is ready... `f'coming soon... {artist} {showtitle} @ {venuename}, {city} {state} {country}'`
  * [ ] link to show page? `f'https://kglw.net/setlists/{permalink}'`


* [ ] when new song is posted (`if songname != 'Coming Soon'`)
  * [x]`f'{songname}'`
  * [ ] link to song page? `f'https://kglw.net/song/{slug}'`
  * [ ] post as reply to the New Show toot?
    * ...does this imply keeping a mapping of show-id-to-initial-toot? maybe could use bookmarks...
